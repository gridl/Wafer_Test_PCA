# Wafer_Test_PCA
Typical semiconductor wafer test data analysis with PCA
PCA is performed with full and a subset of test data and prediction accuracy is compared
This is analyzed for scenarios for varying strength of coupling strengh between the subset of tests and the ultimate outcome (wafer yield)
